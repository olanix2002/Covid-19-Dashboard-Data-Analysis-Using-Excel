## Problem Statement
* COVID-19 pandemic hit the global world harshly in 2020. It was reported that the first infections from SARS-Cov-2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without acquiring special treatment. However , some will become seriosly ill and require medical attentions with death cases recorded across countries.
* The aim of this project is to investigate the spread and mortality rate of COVID-19 pandemic across countries globally.
  To determine the top 5 affected countries and their recovery capability



## Data Sourcing
Raw data file on confirmed cases, death and recovery cases for all countries were sourced from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data where it is updated on a daily basis.


## Findings & Recommendation
### Findinds
After the investigation of  the spread of the pandemic across countries globally,the total confirmed cases globally from jan, 2020 to june 22, 2022 sums up to  152,411,397,891 at 1.75% mortality rate. Result also shows the highest confirmed cases of COVID-19 was recorded in the US (28,285,568,004) while North Korea recorded the lowest confirmed cases (1) globally.
### Recommendations
With the high rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1.75% mortality rate globally since jan 2020 to june 22, 2022, confirmed cases are being recorded everyday.

1. I will recommend that the public should stay safe and stay away from dirty surfaces.
2. People should get vaccinated and normalize regular check up.
